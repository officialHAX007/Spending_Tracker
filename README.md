 Project Overview
Our project is a Spending Tracker Web App built with React.js. It is a single-page application with no backend, and uses localStorage to persist user data across sessions.

 Features
 1. Journal Page
Users can record daily spending entries.

Each entry includes a date, spending category, and amount.

Users can also add new spending categories if needed.

Entries are stored locally in the browser using localStorage.

Entries can be deleted with a Delete button if entered incorrectly.

 2. Dashboard Page
Shows total spending of all time and for the selected month.

Users can select between daily, weekly, and monthly views.

Includes two types of visual analytics:

 Line Chart – Displays spending trend over time.

 Pie Chart – Shows spending distribution by category.

 Technologies Used
React.js (frontend framework)

Chart.js (line and pie charts)

Tailwind CSS (styling)

LocalStorage (data persistence)

React Router (navigation between pages)
